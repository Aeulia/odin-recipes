        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A nice looking pork chop, kind of haram though.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless, center-cut pork chops</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Greek seasoning</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup sliced Kalamata olives</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>¼ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place pork chops between sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper and pound to flatten to 1/2-inch thickness. Season both sides of the chops evenly with Greek seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Place 2 chops in the hot skillet and sear for 2 minutes. Flip and cook until chops are no longer pink in the center, or to desired degree of doneness, 2 to 4 more minutes. Set aside and keep warm. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and repeat to cook remaining 2 chops.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add tomatoes and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are slightly blistered and softened, about 3 minutes. Add olives and lemon juice and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve tomato mixture over pork chops and sprinkle each serving with feta cheese and parsley.</li>
        </ol>
